# Introduction

Welcome to the Campus Rover Lab Notebook, a living resource for and by the students of COSI 119a at Brandeis University. This notebook serves as a place for students to record useful discoveries that will benefit future students when they encounter the same problems. By building up this knowledge base, each generation should be more successful than the last.
