# Color Extraction

As said before, we need a reliable way to extract hands. The first approach I tried was to extract hands by colors: we can wear gloves with striking colors \(green, blue and etc\) and desired hand regions can be obtained by doing color filtering. This approach sometimes worked fine but easily got distracted by subtle changes in lighting at most of the time. In a word, it was not robust enough. After speaking to Prof. Hong, I realized this approached had been tried by hundreds of people decades ago and will never work. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/campusrover/color_filtering).
