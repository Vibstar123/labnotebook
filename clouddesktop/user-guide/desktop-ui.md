## Control

On the left you can find a panel for desktop control such as window scaling.

Left panel:

- Extra keys (ctrl-alt, esc key)
- Clipboard (use this for copy-and-paste)
- Fullscreen
- Settings
  - Scaling Mode -> "Local Scaling" (always)

On the bottom is the taskbar (similar to the one in Windows).

## Window Scaling

To make sure the desktop fits your browser window, go to `Settings` -> `Scaling Mode` -> Choose `Local Scaling`.

## Tailscale IP

Each clouddesktop has a special IP for connecting to our global private network. The tailscale IP can be found on the terminal.

To restart the clouddesktop in case of a freeze, **open a terminal in Code Editor**, type `restart`.

If that did not work, please reach out to your TA.
