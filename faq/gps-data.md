# GPS Data with iPhone (GPS2IP)
#### Brandon J. Lacy

## Overview
The utilization of GPS data on a robot is a common requirement within projects. However, a majority of hardware components that can be configured with the robot produce lackluster results. The iPhone uses sophisticated technology to produce more accurate GPS data, which makes it a prime candidatee for situation in which a robot is in need of accurate information. The application, GPS2IP, uses the technology of the iPhone and communicates it over the internet. Through this application and the iPhone technology an accurate vehicle to produce GPS data is obtained.

### GPS2IP
The application is solely available on iOS. No research was conducted on applications on Android that produce similar functionality. There are two versions of the application on the App Store: GPS2IP ($8.99) and GPS2IP Lite (Free). The free version only allows transmission for 4 minutes before automatically turning off. The paid version has no restrictions. 

## Walkthrough

### iPhone Configuration
#### Turn Off Auto-Lock
Settings > Display & Brightness > Auto-Lock > Never

### GPS2IP Configuration
#### Enable GPS2IP
Open GPS2IP > Toggle On "Enable GPS2IP" Switch

#### NMEA Message Type
Open GPS2IP > Settings > NMEA Messages to Send > Only Toggle On "GLL" Switch

### Python Code
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

'''
A module with a GPS node.

            if neg_num:
                gps_dict[key] = -1 * gps_dict[key]

        # Publish the decoded GPS data
        self.publisher.publish(json.dumps(gps_dict))


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Initialize a ROS node named GPS
    rospy.init_node("gps")
