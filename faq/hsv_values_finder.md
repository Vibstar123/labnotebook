# Finding the HSV Values for any Color

by Sampada Pokharel

This is a quick guide to finding the HSV values for any color that you may need for you project. We found this particularly helpful for following a line.

## Prerequisite

- A robot with a camera
- VNC

## Basic Steps

- Connect your robot. You can find the guide <a href = "https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/bru/connect-to-robot"> here </a>
- Once your robot is connected, open vnc and run cvexample.py file in the terminal. It should be in prrexamples folder(prrexample/src/cvexample.py).
- In a seperate terminal, run rqt. This should bring up sliders for the hsv values and you can change the vlues to find the hsv values for you desired color.

Here is what it should look like.
