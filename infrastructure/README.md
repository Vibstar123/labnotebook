# Infrastructure

A collection of notes and documents about all the equipment and facilities we have in the Robotics lab at Brandeis. Our lab is for undergraduates who come to us often never having touched a physical robot let alone programmed them. There are lots of very simple procedures that you can learn by picking them up randomly. We document them here for our students.
