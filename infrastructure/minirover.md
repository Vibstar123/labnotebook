## MiniRover

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

MiniRover is our modification of the GoPiGo3 robot. It comes with software, a VPN and all kinds of fancy things which is why I decided to give it a special name. This page is under construction as I troubleshoot and make notes about things. I expect feedback from everyone where the instructions don't meet reality!

### Building

#### GoPiGo3 Basic Kit

We recommend that you start with a [GoPiGo3 Basic Kit](https://www.dexterindustries.com/store/gopigo3-base-kit/). Build it following the instructions. There is a lot written and a lot to google about it. Here are some useful links:

* [Dexter Forum](https://www.dexterindustries.com/store/gopigo3-base-kit/) - where you can get many questions answered
* [Build your GoPiGo3](https://edu.workbencheducation.com/cwists/preview/26659x) - where you find step by step instructions.
* [MiniRover Purchase Program](http://cosi119r.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/background/13_gpg_purchase.md/) - instructions for students taking Cosi119a at Brandeis University to order a miniRover.

In addition to what you received with the Basic Kit you will need the following to get through the instructions.

* A Raspberry Pi 3+
* A battery pack
* Y-Cable
* A MicroSD card

The Battery pack is different form what the instructions talk about. The Y-Cable is used to connect the barrel connector of the battery pack with the corresponding battery connector on the "Red Board" which in turn will power the Raspberry Pi.



The robot will come with a microSD card with the dexter software. There is some very very simple calibration that you need to do.

### GoPiGo3 -> MiniRover

In addition to the basic kit you will also get a rechargeable battery pack, some cables and a Lidar.
