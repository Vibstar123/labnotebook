## LED on the Red Board

* Blinking green is the “starting up” indication.
* Solid green is the “ready” indication.*
* Solid yellow is the “low battery” caution indication.
* Solid red is the “low battery” warning.
* Blinking red is the “shutting down” indication.
* Blinking purple is (AFAIK) the “I don’t know what is going on” indication, but I could be wrong.

But, note that all of these indications are only valid when using a Dexter Industries / Modular Robotics operating system. (i.e. Raspbian for Robots, GoPiGo OS, or Dexter OS). It will continue to blink green when using any other O/S. The Minirover configuration is Ubuntu!
