## Steps

1. Measure the static obstacles such as walls, doors, and corners that will not be changed ever. The measurements should be in centimeters.
2. Use keynote to draw the space.

## Little Tips

1. better to have two people measure the walls because it could be longer than 10 meters\(10000 centimeters\) that is very hard for one person to do the job.
2. Use a mouse to draw the map is going to save you a lot of time because you can easily drag the lines on the keynote.
3. Be patient. Each map is going to take you about four hours.
