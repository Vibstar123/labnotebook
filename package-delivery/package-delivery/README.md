# Package Delivery

## Related Nodes

* `package_handler.py`
* `package_sender.py`
* `recording_sender.py`

## Overview

The package delivery stack is comprised of one main node, `package_handler.py`, and two secondary nodes `package_sender.py` and `recording_sender.py`. Each secondary node corresponds to a type of package that can be handled by the handler \(the current implementation supports physical packages on top of the robot, and voice recordings recorded on the on-board laptop. Each secondary node \(when pinged on its respective topic\) generates a file with a specific suffix \(`.package` and `.wav` respectively\) that will be processed accordingly by the package handler. Each file type has an associated package release protocol, which removes the package filename from the `packages` queue \(maintained by the handler node\).

## Demo

* Run `recording_sender.py` on-board \(so computer microphone is accessed\)
* Run `package_handler.py` and `package_sender.py`
* After navigating to the package sender \(wait for WAITING state\) place package on the robot
* After being prompted, hold down B0, B1, or B2 on the robot's base to record a message
* Send the robot a delivery navigation goal
* Once the robot has reached the goal \(wait for WAITING state\) pick up the package.  The robot will also play back the audio recording
* After the
