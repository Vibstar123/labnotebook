# BowlingBot

## Objective
Our objective was to use a claw attachment on a Platform bot to be able to grab and roll a ball at a set of pins, akin to bowling. We used a fiducial in order for the robot to locate the bowling ball and grab it, another fiducial so that the robot may find the start of the bowling alley, as well as a third fiducial so that the robot was able to orient itself toward the middle of the pins before performing the bowling motion and knocking over the pins with the ball.
