## Introduction
“You can’t be an expert in everything. Nobody’s brain is big enough.” A quote that’s been stated by Pito at least twice this semester and once last semester in his software entrepreneurship course, but one that hadn’t truly sunk in until the time in which I, Brandon, sat down to write this report with my teammates, Naimul and Jimmy. I’ve greatly enjoyed the time spent on group projects within my professional experiences, but always aired on the side of caution with group work in college as there’s a much higher chance an individual won’t pull their weight. It’s that fear of lackluster performance from the other team members that has always driven me to want to work independently. I’d always ask myself, “What is there to lose when you work alone? You’ll grow your technical expertise horizontally and vertically in route to bolster your resume to land that job you’ve always wanted, nevermind the removal of all of those headaches that come from the incorporation of others. There is nothing to lose, right?” <br>

**Wrong.**<br>

You lose out on the possibility that the individuals you could’ve partnered with are good people, with strong technical skills that would’ve made your life a whole lot easier throughout the semester through the separation of duties. You lose out on a lot of laughs and the opportunity to make new friends. Most importantly, however, you lose out on the chance of being partnered with individuals who are experts in areas which are completely foreign to you.There is nobody to counter your weaknesses. You can’t be an expert in everything, but you can most certainly take the gamble to partner with individuals to collectively form one big brain full of expertise to accomplish a project of the magnitude in which we’ve accomplished this semester. <br>

I know my brain certainly wasn’t big enough to accomplish this project on my own. I’m grateful these two men reached out to me with interest in this project. Collectively, we’ve set the foundation for future iterations of the development of campus rover and we think that’s pretty special considering the long term impact beyond the scope of this course. So, I guess Pito was right after all; one brain certainly isn’t big enough to carry a project, but multiple brains that each contribute different areas of expertise. Now that’s a recipe for success. <br>
