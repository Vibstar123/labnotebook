# Danger Signs

## Author: Matthew Millendorf 

### Section 1 - Introduction: 

	Object avoidance is of the upmost importance for autonomous robotics applications. From autonomous vehicles to distribution center robots, the ability to avoid collisions is essentially to any successful robotics system. Our inspiration for this project came from the idea that the current Campus Rover significantly lacks semantic scene understanding. One type of scenes of particular concern are those that pose immediate danger to the robot. 
A possible scenarios is the campus rover is delivering a package and is moving along the hallway. The floor is wet and the robot is unable to understand the meaning of the yellow wet floor sign. The robot’s navigation system avoids the wet floor sign, but the radius of the water spill is greater than the width of the wet floor sign, and the robot’s wheels hit the water puddle. There is a staircase adjacent to this spill and when the robot’s wheels make contact with water, it spirals sideways, crashing down the stairs, breaking several of its components and the contents of the package. Our aim in this project is to provide a way for robots to avoid these scenarios through recognition of the trademark wet floor signs. 
	The following report will go as follows. In section II, we will dive into relevant literature concerning our problem. Following that, we will detail our process and the difficulties we faced. Finally, in Section IV, we will provide a reflection of how our project went.
