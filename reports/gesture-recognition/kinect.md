# Attempts to using Kinect libraries

This still seems the best approach \(if it ever worked\). The Kinect camera was developed, at the first place,for human body gesture recognition and I could not think of any reason not using it but to reinvent wheels. However, since the library interfacing Kinect and ROS never worked and contains little documentation \( meaning it is very difficult to debug\), I spent many sleepless nights and still wasn't able to get it working.**However, for the next generation, I will still strongly recommend you give it a try.**

_ROS BY EXAMPLE V1 INDIGO:_ **Chapter 10.9** contains detailed instructions on how to get the package _openni\_tracker_ working but make sure you install required drivers listed in **chapter 10.3.1** before you start.
